### Using the component

Interaction with the content in an overlay is typically constrained, as richer interactions/workflows should occur within a separate UI mechanism (such as a new page, `Dialog` or `Drawer`).

#### When to use

- To expose interactive and essential elements within a tooltip to carry out in-context tasks.
- For filter or dropdown panels that overlay content.
- When acknowledgement on overlay content is needed. An overlay only dismissess after user interaction.

#### When not to use

- To notify and present critical information that requires immediate action from the user. Instead, use [`Dialog`](../dialog).
- To provide a non-focusable and informative hint. Instead, use [`Tooltip`](../tooltip).
